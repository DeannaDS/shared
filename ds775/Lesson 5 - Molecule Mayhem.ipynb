More likely, our randomly generated molecules will not be allowed solutions. (There are rules about which atoms can bond together and in what order.) Our goal will be to make as many allowed molecules as possible, by making small changes to the existing candidate in each iteration. (Don't worry. We'll let you know what the allowed molecules look like.) \n",
